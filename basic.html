                    <section>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Welcome to the first tutorial!</p>
                            <p>Before jumping into OpenGL, you will first learn how to build the code that goes with each tutorial, how to run it, and most importantly, how to play with the code yourself.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                        <section>
                            <h3>OpenTK 1.1</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>This is a wrapper for .NET to give you access to all the OpenGL commands. You can grab it from <a href="http://www.opentk.com/">here</a>.</p>
                            </section>
                            <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>This series will use Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition which can be found <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx">here</a>. Visual Studio 2010 or later should also work without any changes.</p>
                            </section>
                            <h3>Experience</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Experience with any programming language ( C, Java, Lisp, Javascript, whatever ) is better to fully understand the code, but not needed ; it will merely be more complicated to learn two things at the same time.</p>
                                <p>All tutorials are written in “C#” : Lots of effort has been made to make the code as simple as possible. No templates or classes. This way, you will be able to understand everything even if you only know Java.</p>
                            </section>
                        </section>

                        <h2>Forget Everything</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>
                                You don’t have to know anything, but you have to forget everything you know about OpenGL. If you know about something that looks like glBegin(), forget it. Here you will learn modern OpenGL (OpenGL 3 and 4) , and most online tutorials teach “old” OpenGL (OpenGL 1 and 2). So forget everything you might know before your brain melts from the mix.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Building the tutorials</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>All tutorials can be built on Windows <del>, Linux, and MAC</del>:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li> Update your drivers !! doooo it. You’ve been warned.</li>
                                <li> Download visual studio express or community edition</li>
                                <li> Download the source code of the tutorials</li>
                                <li> Build the project</li>
                                <li> Play with the samples !</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Windows</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Follow these steps if you would like to checkout the completed source code and to play with each tutorial. We will be building this repository based on the tutorials.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li> Updating your drivers should be easy. Just go to NVIDIA’s or AMD’s website and download the drivers. If unsure about your GPU model : Control Panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; System -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Display adapter. If you have an integrated Intel GPU, drivers are usually provided by your OEM (Dell, HP, …).</li>
                                    <li> We suggest using Visual Studio 2010+ Express as a compiler. You can download it for free here.</li>
                                    <li> Check out the source code, for instance in <code>C:\Users\XYZ\Projects\OpenGLTutorials\</code>.</li>
                                    <li> Open <code>C:\Users\XYZ\Projects\OpenGLTutorials\</code>. You will see a <code>OpenGLTutorials.sln</code> file : open it with Visual Studio.</li>
                                    <li> In the Build menu, click Build All. Hopefuly no error occurs.</li>
                                    <li> Set playground as the default start up project by right clicking it and selecting the option.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Press F5 to run the project</span>
                                        <div class="row">
                                            <img class="col-md-12" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/233e72d8b9d04ddfed692a1eeb8d0d7472e170f9/687474703a2f2f7777772e6f70656e676c2d7475746f7269616c2e6f72672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031312f30342f656d7074795f77696e646f772e706e67" alt="sample screen" data-canonical-src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/empty_window.png">

                        </section>
                        <h2>Running the tutorials</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>You can run the tutorials directly from the directory : simply double-click on the executable. If you like command line best, cd to the right directory.</p>
                            <p>You can also run the tutorials from the IDE by right clicking a project and selecting it as the start up project.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Following along</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Each tutorial comes with its source code and data, which can be found in tutorialXX/. However, you will never modify these projects : they are for reference only. Open playground/playground.cpp, and tweak this file instead. Torture it in any way you like. If you are lost, simply cut’n paste any tutorial in it, and everything should be back to normal.</p>
                            <p>We will provide snippets of code all along the tutorials. Don’t hesitate to cut’n paste them directly in the playground while you’re reading : experimentation is good. Avoid simply reading the finished code, you won’t learn a lot this way. Even with simple cut’n pasting, you’ll get your boatload of problems.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Starting from scratch</h2>
                        <section>
                            <ol>
                                <li> First thing you want to do is open up Visual Studio.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Next go to <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New</code> -&gt; <code>Project</code>
                                </li>
                                <li> Select a Visual C# Console Application</li>
                                <li>
                                    For the <code>Name</code> you can put <code>T1 - Opening a window</code>
                                </li>
                                <li> For the location you can set it where ever you like, the default should be <code>c:\users\&lt;YOUR_USER&gt;\documents\visual studio 2013\Projects\</code> which is what we will use</li>
                                <li>
                                    Check <code>Create directory for solution</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For the solution name, we will set it to <code>OpenGLTutorials</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Last we need to add a reference to OpenTK to our project, you will have to do this every time you start a new tutorial, so remember these steps.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Right click <code>References</code> under <code>T1 - Opening a window</code> and select <code>Add Reference</code>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Next you want to make sure that <code>Assemblie</code> -&gt; <code>Framework</code> is selected and in the search assemblies on the right, type <code>opentk</code>. Note: If there is more than one listed, take the latest 1.1 version, for example, mine is <code>File Version: 1.1.1664.6217</code>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Check the correct <code>OpenTK</code> entry and click <code>OK</code>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li> You are now ready for your first tutorial</li>
                            </ol>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Opening the window</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Finally ! OpenGL code ! Well, not really. All tutorials show you the “low level” way to do things, so that you can see that no magic happens.</p>
                            <p>Ok, let’s go. First we need to open up <code>program.cs</code> and set the correct <code>using</code> statements, they should look like this.</p>
<pre><code>using System;
using OpenTK;
using OpenTK.Input;
using OpenTK.Graphics;
</code></pre>
                            <p>We can add this to get our first OpenGL window!</p>
                            <pre><code>using (var game = new GameWindow(1024, 768,
                       GraphicsMode.Default,          //default format
                       "Tutorial 01",                 //title in the window
                       GameWindowFlags.Default,       //default window style
                       DisplayDevice.Default,         //default monitor
                       3,3,                           //we want opengl 3.3
                       GraphicsContextFlags.Default   //default context
                       ))
{
    game.Visible = true;   //show the window
</code></pre>
                            <p>Build this and run. A window should appear, and be closed right away. Of course ! We need to wait until the user hits the Escape key :</p>
                        </section>
                        <pre><code>//variable to store the latest keyboard state
KeyboardState keyboard;
do
{
    // Draw nothing, see you in tutorial 2 !
    // Swap buffers
    game.SwapBuffers();
    game.ProcessEvents();
    //we need to poll the current keyboard state
    keyboard = OpenTK.Input.Keyboard.GetState();
}   // Check if the ESC key was pressed or the window was closed
while (!keyboard[Key.Escape]);</code></pre>
                        <p>And this concludes our first tutorial ! In Tutorial 2, you will learn how to actually draw a triangle.</p>
                        <p>Here is the final output...</p>

<!--  THE FIRST TRIANGLE    -->

                    <h1>The first triangle</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>This will be another long tutorial.</p>
                        <p>OpenGL 3 makes it easy to write complicated stuff, but at the expense that drawing a simple triangle is actually quite difficult.</p>
                        <p>Don’t forget to cut’n paste the code on a regular basis.</p>
                        <h2>The VAO</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>I won’t dig into details now, but you need to create a Vertex Array Object and set it as the current one :</p>
                            <pre><code>var vertexArrayID = GL.GenVertexArray();
GL.BindVertexArray(vertexArrayID);
</code></pre>
                            <p>Do this once your window is created (= after the OpenGL Context creation) and before any other OpenGL call.</p>
                            <p>If you really want to know more about VAOs, there are a few other tutorials out there, but this is not very important.</p>

                        <h2>Screen coordinates</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>A triangle is defined by three points. When talking about “points” in 3D graphics, we usually use the word “vertex” ( “vertices” on the plural ). A vertex has 3 coordinates : X, Y and Z. You can think about these three coordinates in the following way :</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>X in on your right</li>
                                <li>Y is up</li>
                                <li>Z is towards your back (yes, behind, not in front of you)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>But here is a better way to visualize this : use the Right Hand Rule</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>X is your thumb</li>
                                <li>Y is your index</li>
                                <li>Z is your middle finger. If you put your thumb to the right and your index to the sky, it will point to your back, too.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Having the Z in this direction is weird, so why is it so ? Short answer : because 100 years of Right Hand Rule Math will give you lots of useful tools. The only downside is an unintuitive Z.</p>
                            <p>On a side note, notice that you can move your hand freely : your X, Y and Z will be moving, too. More on this later.</p>
                            <p>So we need three 3D points in order to make a triangle ; let’s go :</p>
                            <pre><code>var g_vertex_buffer_data = new[] {
  -1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f,
   1.0f,  -1.0f, 0.0f,
   0.0f,   1.0f, 0.0f,
};</code></pre>
                            <p>The first vertex is (-1,-1,0). This means that unless we transform it in some way, it will be displayed at (-1,-1) on the screen. What does this mean ? The screen origin is in the middle, X is on the right, as usual, and Y is up. This is what it gives on a wide screen :</p>
                            <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/screenCoordinates-300x165.png" /></p>
                            <p>This is something you can’t change, it’s built in your graphics card. So (-1,-1) is the bottom left corner of your screen. (1,-1) is the bottom right, and (0,1) is the middle top. So this triangle should take most of the screen.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Drawing our triangle</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>The next step is to give this triangle to OpenGL. We do this by creating a buffer:</p>
                            <pre><code>// This will identify our vertex buffer
// Generate 1 buffer, put the resulting identifier in vertexbuffer
var vertexBuffer = GL.GenBuffer();
                
// The following commands will talk about our 'vertexbuffer' buffer
GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBuffer);

// Give our vertices to OpenGL.
var vertexBufferSize = new IntPtr(sizeof(float) * g_vertex_buffer_data.Length);
GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBufferSize, g_vertex_buffer_data, 
                                BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw);
</code></pre>
                            <p>This needs to be done only once.</p>
                            <p>Now, in our main loop, where we used to draw “nothing”, we can draw our magnificent triangle :</p>
                            <pre><code>GL.EnableVertexAttribArray(0);
GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBuffer);
GL.VertexAttribPointer(
    0,                             // attribute 0. No particular reason for 0, 
                                   // but must match the layout in the shader.
    3,                             // size
    VertexAttribPointerType.Float, // type
    false,                         // normalized?
    0,                             // stride
    0                              // array buffer offset
);

// draw the triangles
// Starting from vertex 0; 3 vertices total -> 1 triangle
GL.DrawArrays(PrimitiveType.Triangles, 0, 3);
GL.DisableVertexAttribArray(0);</code></pre>
                            <p>If you’re on lucky, you can see the result <span class="label label-danger">(don’t panic if you don’t)</span> :</p>

                            <p>Now this is some boring white. Let’s see how we can improve it by painting it in red. This is done by using something called shaders.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Shaders</h2>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Shader compilation</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>In the simplest possible configuration, you will need two shaders : one called Vertex Shader, which will be executed for each vertex, and one called Fragment Shader, which will be executed for each sample. And since we use 4x antialising, we have 4 samples in each pixel.</p>
                                <p>Shaders are programmed in a language called GLSL : GL Shader Language, which is part of OpenGL. Unlike C or Java, GLSL has to be compiled at run time, which means that each and every time you launch your application, all your shaders are recompiled.</p>
                                <p>The two shaders are usually in separate files. In this example, we have <code>simple.frag</code> and <code>simple.vert</code> . The extension is irrelevant, it could be .txt or .glsl .</p>
                                <p>So here’s the code. It’s not very important to fully understand it, since you often do this only once in a program, so comments should be enough. Notice that just as buffers, shaders are not directly accessible : we just have an ID. The actual implementation is hidden inside the driver.</p>
                                <pre><code>private static int LoadShaders(string vertexPath, string fragmentPath)
{
    var vertexID = GL.CreateShader(ShaderType.VertexShader);
    var fragmentID = GL.CreateShader(ShaderType.FragmentShader);
    try
    {
        LoadShader(vertexID, vertexPath, ShaderType.VertexShader);
        LoadShader(fragmentID, fragmentPath, ShaderType.FragmentShader);
        Console.WriteLine("Linking program {0}, {1}", vertexPath, fragmentPath);
        var programID = GL.CreateProgram();
        GL.AttachShader(programID, vertexID);
        GL.AttachShader(programID, fragmentID);
        GL.LinkProgram(programID);

        if (result != 1)

                            <section>
                                <p>Let’s write our vertex shader first.</p>
                                <p>The first line tells the compiler that we will use OpenGL 3′s syntax.</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">#version 330 core</code></pre>
                                <p>The second line declares the input data :</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">layout(location = 0) in vec3 vertexPosition_modelspace;</code></pre>
                                <p>Let’s explain this line in detail :</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>“vec3″ is a vector of 3 components in GLSL. It is similar (but different) to the glm::vec3 we used to declare our triangle. The important thing is that if we use 3 components in C++, we use 3 components in GLSL too.</li>
                                    <li>“layout(location = 0)” refers to the buffer we use to feed the vertexPosition_modelspace attribute. Each vertex can have numerous attributes : A position, one or several colours, one or several texture coordinates, lots of other things. OpenGL doesn’t know what a colour is : it just sees a vec3. So we have to tell him which buffer corresponds to which input. We do that by setting the layout to the same value as the first parameter to glVertexAttribPointer. The value “0″ is not important, it could be 12 (but no more than glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS, &v) ), the important thing is that it’s the same number on both sides.</li>
                                    <li>“vertexPosition_modelspace” could be anything else. It will contain the position of the vertex for each run of the vertex shader.</li>
                                    <li>“in” means that this is some input data. Soon we’ll see the “out” keyword.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The function that is called for each vertex is called main, just as in C :</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">void main(){</code></pre>
                                <p>Our main function will merely set the vertex’ position to whatever was in the buffer. So if we gave (1,1), the triangle would have one of its vertices at the top right corner of the screen. We’ll see in the next tutorial how to do some more interesting computations on the input position.</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">    gl_Position.xyz = vertexPosition_modelspace;
    gl_Position.w = 1.0;
 }</code></pre>
                                <p>gl_Position is one of the few built-in variables : you have to assign some value to it. Everything else is optional; we’ll see what “everything else” means in Tutorial 4.</p>
                            </section>
                            <h3>Our fragment shader</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>For our first fragment shader, we will do something really simple : set the color of each fragment to red. (Remember, there are 4 fragment in a pixel because we use 4x AA)</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">#version 330 core
out vec3 color;
 
void main(){
    color = vec3(1,0,0);
}</code></pre> 
                                <p>So yeah, vec3(1,0,0) means red. This is because on computer screens, colour is represented by a Red, Green, and Blue triplet, in this order. So (1,0,0) means Full Red, no green and no blue.</p>
                                <pre><code>GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit | ClearBufferMask.ColorBufferBit);</code></pre>
                                <p>and then tell OpenGL that you want to use your shader :</p>
                                <pre><code>// Use our shader
GL.UseProgram(programID);</code></pre>
                                <p>… and presto, here’s your red triangle !</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/red_triangle-300x231.png" /></p>

                        <section>
                            <p>Before the main loop, call our LoadShaders function :</p>
                            <pre><code>// Create and compile our GLSL program from the shaders
  var programID = LoadShaders("simple.vert", "simple.frag");
                                </code></pre>
                            <p>Now inside the main loop, first clear the screen. This will change the background color to dark blue because of the glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.4f, 0.0f) call above the main loop :</p>

                        <h2>Homogeneous coordinates</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Until then, we only considered 3D vertices as a (x,y,z) triplet. Let’s introduce w. We will now have (x,y,z,w) vectors.</p>
                            <p>This will be more clear soon, but for now, just remember this :</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If w == 1, then the vector (x,y,z,1) is a position in space.</li>
                                <li>If w == 0, then the vector (x,y,z,0) is a direction.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>(In fact, remember this forever.)</p>
                            <p>What difference does this make ? Well, for a rotation, it doesn’t change anything. When you rotate a point or a direction, you get the same result. However, for a translation (when you move the point in a certain direction), things are different. What could mean “translate a direction” ? Not much.</p>
                            <p>Homogeneous coordinates allow us to use a single mathematical formula to deal with these two cases.</p>

                            <section>
                                <p>Simply put, a matrix is an array of numbers with a predefined number of rows and colums. For instance, a 2×3 matrix can look like this :</p>

                                <p>In 3D graphics we will only use 4×4 matrices. They will allow us to transform our (x,y,z,w) vertices. This is done by multiplying the vertex with the matrix :</p>
                                <p><strong>Matrix x Vertex  (in this order !!) = TransformedVertex</strong></p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MatrixXVect-300x71.gif" /></p>
                                <p>This isn’t as scary as it looks. Put your left finger on the a, and your right finger on the x. This is ax. Move your left finger to the next number (b), and your right finger to the next number (y). You’ve got by. Once again : cz. Once again : dw. ax + by + cz + dw. You’ve got your new x ! Do the same for each line, and you’ll get your new (x,y,z,w) vector.</p>
                                <p>Now this is quite boring to compute, an we will do this often, so let’s ask the computer to do it instead.</p>

                            <h3>Translation matrices</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>These are the most simple tranformation matrices to understand. A translation matrix look like this :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/translationMatrix.png" /></p>
                                <p>where X,Y,Z are the values that you want to add to your position.</p>
                                <p>So if we want to translate the vector (10,10,10,1) of 10 units in the X direction, we get :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/translationExamplePosition1.png" /></p>
                                <p>(do it ! doooooo it)</p>
                                <p>… and we get a (20,10,10,1) homogeneous vector ! Remember, the 1 means that it is a position, not a direction. So our transformation didn’t change the fact that we were dealing with a position, which is good.</p>
                                <p>Let’s now see what happens to a vector that represents a direction towards the -z axis : (0,0,-1,0)</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/translationExampleDirection1.png" /></p>
                                <p>… ie our original (0,0,-1,0) direction, which is great because as I said ealier, moving a direction does not make sense.</p>
                                <p>So, how does this translate to code ?</p>
                                <p><strong>In C++, with GLM:</strong></p>

                                <p><string>In GLSL :</string> Well, in fact, you almost never do this. Most of the time, you use glm::translate() in C++ to compute your matrix, send it to GLSL, and do only the multiplication :</p>

                            <section>
                                <p>This one is special. It doesn’t do anything. But I mention it because it’s as important as knowing that multiplying A by 1.0 gives A.</p>

                            <h3>Scaling matrices</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Scaling matrices are quite easy too :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/scalingMatrix.png" /></p>
                                <p>So if you want to scale a vector (position or direction, it doesn’t matter) by 2.0 in all directions :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/scalingExample.png" /></p>
                                <p>and the w still didn’t change. You may ask : what is the meaning of “scaling a direction” ? Well, often, not much, so you usually don’t do such a thing, but in some (rare) cases it can be handy.
(notice that the identity matrix is only a special case of scaling matrices, with (X,Y,Z) = (1,1,1). It’s also a special case of translation matrix with (X,Y,Z)=(0,0,0), by the way)</p>

                                <p>These are quite complicated. I’ll skip the details here, as it’s not important to know their exact layout for everyday use. For more information, please have a look to the Matrices and Quaternions FAQ (popular resource, probably available in your language as well).</p>
                                <p><strong>In C++ :</strong></p>

                            <h3>Cumulating transformations</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>So now we know how to rotate, translate, and scale our vectors. It would be great to combine these transformations. This is done by multiplying the matrices together, for instance :</p>
                                <pre><code>TransformedVector = TranslationMatrix * RotationMatrix * ScaleMatrix * OriginalVector;</code></pre>
                                <p class="label label-danger">This lines actually performs the scaling FIRST, and THEN the rotation, and THEN the translation. This is how matrix multiplication works.</p>
                                <p>Writing the operations in another order wouldn’t produce the same result. Try it yourself :</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>make one step ahead ( beware of your computer ) and turn left;</li>
                                    <li>turn left, and make one step ahead</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>As a matter of fact, the order above is what you will usually need for game characters and other items : Scale it first if needed; then set its direction, then translate it. For instance, given a ship model (rotations have been removed for simplification) :</p>
                                <p><strong>The wrong way :</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You translate the ship by (10,0,0). Its center is now at 10 units of the origin.</li>
                                    <li>You scale your ship by 2. Every coordinate is multiplied by 2 relative to the origin, which is far away… So you end up with a big ship, but centered at 2*10 = 20. Which you don’t want.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>The right way :</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You scale your ship by 2. You get a big ship, centered on the origin.</li>
                                    <li>You translate your ship. It’s still the same size, and at the right distance.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Matrix-matrix multiplication is very similar to matrix-vector multiplication, so I’ll once again skip some details and redirect you the the Matrices and Quaternions FAQ if needed. For now, we’ll simply ask the computer to do it :</p>

                        <h2>The Model, View and Projection matrices</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p><i>For the rest of this tutorial, we will suppose that we know how to draw Blender’s favourite 3d model : the monkey Suzanne.</i></p>
                            <p>The Model, View and Projection matrices are a handy tool to separate transformations cleanly. You may not use this (after all, that’s what we did in tutorials 1 and 2). But you should. This is the way everybody does, because it separates everything cleanly, as we’ll see.</p>
                            <h3>The Model matrix</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>This model, just as our beloved red triangle, is defined by a set of vertices. The X,Y,Z coordinates of these vertices are defined relative to the object’s center : that is, if a vertex is at (0,0,0), it is at the center of the object.</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/model.png" /></p>
                                <p>We’d like to be able to move this model, maybe because the player controls it with the keyboard and the mouse. Easy, you just learnt do do so : translation*rotation*scale, and done. You apply this matrix to all your vertices at each frame (in GLSL, not in C++!) and everything moves. Something that doesn’t move will be at the _center of the world_.</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/world.png" /></p>
                                <p>Your vertices are now in World Space. <i>This is the meaning of the black arrow in the image below : We went from Model Space (all vertices defined relatively to the center of the model) to World Space (all vertices defined relatively to the center of the world).</i></p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/model_to_world.png" /></p>
                                <p><strong>We can sum this up with the following diagram :</strong></p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/M.png" /></p>

                            <h3>The View matrix</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>Let’s quote Futurama again :</p>
                                <p>The engines don’t move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/camera.png" /></p>
                                <p>When you think about it, the same applies to cameras. It you want to view a moutain from another angle, you can either move the camera… or move the mountain. While not practical in real life, this is really simple and handy in Computer Graphics.</p>
                                <p>So initially your camera is at the origin of the World Space. In order to move the world, you simply introduce another matrix. Let’s say you want to move your camera of 3 units to the right (+X). This is equivalent to moving your whole world (meshes included) 3 units to the LEFT ! (-X). While you brain melts, let’s do it :</p>
                                <pre><code>glm</code></pre>
                                <p>gain, the image below illustrates this : <i>We went from World Space (all vertices defined relatively to the center of the world, as we made so in the previous section) to Camera Space (all vertices defined relatively to the camera).</i></p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/model_to_world_to_camera.png" /></p>
                                <p>Before you head explodes from this, enjoy GLM’s great glm::lookAt function:</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">glm::mat4 CameraMatrix = glm::lookAt(
    cameraPosition, // the position of your camera, in world space
    cameraTarget,   // where you want to look at, in world space
    upVector        // probably glm::vec3(0,1,0), but (0,-1,0) would make you looking upside-down, which can be great too
);</code></pre>
                                <p>Here’s the compulsory diagram :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MV.png" /></p>
                                <p>This is not over yet, though.</p>
                            </section>
                            <h3>The Projection matrix</h3>
                            <section>
                                <p>We’re now in Camera Space. This means that after all theses transformations, a vertex that happens to have x==0 and y==0 should be rendered at the center of the screen. But we can’t use only the x and y coordinates to determine where an object should be put on the screen : its distance to the camera (z) counts, too ! For two vertices with similar x and y coordinates, the vertex with the biggest z coordinate will be more on the center of the screen than the other.</p>
                                <p>This is called a perspective projection :</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/model_to_world_to_camera_to_homogeneous.png" /></p>
                                <p>And luckily for us, a 4×4 matrix can represent this projection¹ :</p>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">// Generates a really hard-to-read matrix, but a normal, standard 4x4 matrix nonetheless
glm::mat4 projectionMatrix = glm::perspective(
    FoV,         // The horizontal Field of View, in degrees : the amount of "zoom". Think "camera lens". Usually between 90° (extra wide) and 30° (quite zoomed in)
    4.0f / 3.0f, // Aspect Ratio. Depends on the size of your window. Notice that 4/3 == 800/600 == 1280/960, sounds familiar ?
    0.1f,        // Near clipping plane. Keep as big as possible, or you'll get precision issues.
    100.0f       // Far clipping plane. Keep as little as possible.
);</code></pre>
                                <p>One last time :</p>
                                <p><i>We went from Camera Space (all vertices defined relatively to the camera) to Homogeneous Space (all vertices defined in a small cube. Everything inside the cube is onscreen).</i></p>
                                <p>And the final diagram :</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MVP-235x300.png" /></p>
                                <p>Here’s another diagram so that you understand better what happens with this Projection stuff. Before projection, we’ve got our blue objects, in Camera Space, and the red shape represents the frustum of the camera : the part of the scene that the camera is actually able to see.</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nondeforme.png" /></p>
                                <p>Multiplying everything by the Projection Matrix has the following effect :</p>
                                <p><img class="col-md-12" src="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/homogeneous.png" /></p>
                                <p>In this image, the frustum is now a perfect cube (between -1 and 1 on all axes, it’s a little bit hard to see it), and all blue objects have been deformed in the same way. Thus, the objects that are near the camera ( = near the face of the cube that we can’t see) are big, the others are smaller. Seems like real life !</p>
                                <p>Let’s see what it looks like from the “behind” the frustum :</p>

                                <p>Here you get your image ! It’s just a little bit too square, so another mathematical transformation is applied to fit this to the actual window size :</p>

                                <p>And this is the image that is actually rendered !</p>

                            <section>
                                <p>… Just a standard matrix multiplication as you already love them !</p>
                                <pre><code>glm</code></pre>
                                <pre><code class="glsl">// GLSL : apply it
transformed_vertex = MVP * in_vertex;</code></pre>
                            </section>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
                        <p>First step : generating our MVP matrix. This must be done for each model you render.</p>
                        <pre><code>GLM</code></pre>
                        <p>Second step : give it to GLSL</p>
                        <pre><code>c++</code></pre>
                        <p>Third step : use it in GLSL to transform our vertices</p>
                        <pre><code class="glsl">in vec3 vertexPosition_modelspace;
uniform mat4 MVP;
 
void main(){
 
    // Output position of the vertex, in clip space : MVP * position
    vec4 v = vec4(vertexPosition_modelspace,1); // Transform an homogeneous 4D vector, remember ?
    gl_Position = MVP * v;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>Done ! Here is the same triangle as in tutorial 2, still at the origin (0,0,0), but viewed in perspective from point (4,3,3), heads up (0,1,0), with a 45° field of view.</p>

                        <p>In tutorial 6 you’ll learn how to modify these values dynamically using the keyboard and the mouse to create a game-like camera, but first, we’ll learn how to give our 3D models some colour (tutorial 4) and textures (tutorial 5).</p>

                    <h2>Exercises</h2>
                    <section>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try changing the glm::perspective</li>
                            <li>Instead of using a perspective projection, use an orthographic projection (glm::ortho)</li>
                            <li>Modify ModelMatrix to translate, rotate, then scale the triangle</li>
                            <li>Do the same thing, but in different orders. What do you notice ? What is the “best” order that you would want to use for a character ?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <h2>Addendum</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>1 : <i>[...]luckily for us, a 4×4 matrix can represent this projection¹ : Actually, this is not correct. A perspective transformation is not affine, and as such, can’t be represented entirely by a matrix. After beeing multiplied by the ProjectionMatrix, homogeneous coordinates are divided by their own W component. This W component happens to be -Z (because the projection matrix has been crafted this way). This way, points that are far away from the origin are divided by a big Z; their X and Y coordinates become smaller; points become more close to each other, objects seem smaller; and this is what gives the perspective.</i></p>
